Abstract
This white paper presents the Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory (WLRT) — a universal market model
in which observed price dynamics emerge from wave-like redistribution of liquidity across price space.
The theory treats financial markets as structured dynamical systems governed by conservation,
propagation, and dissipation of liquidity. Price is defined as a secondary observable derived from the
state of the liquidity field rather than as a primary driver.

1. Motivation
WLRT proposes a modeling layer where price is not fundamental. Price is an observable projection of
internal liquidity dynamics.

2. Price Space Representation
The market is represented as a one-dimensional price space divided into discrete sectors containing
effective liquidity.

3. Fundamental Quantities
Liquidity density, gradients, flux, redistribution speed, dissipation, and external sources define
system behavior.

4. Definition of Price
Price is the liquidity-weighted center of the system.

5. Liquidity Dynamics
Liquidity redistribution follows a damped wave equation capturing propagation and dissipation.

6. Market Regimes
Standing waves, traveling waves, critical damping, and impulse responses correspond to market regimes.

7. Conservation Properties
In absence of external sources, total liquidity is conserved.

8. Interpretation of Volatility
Volatility reflects amplitude and intensity of liquidity oscillations.

9. GRID Trading Systems
GRID systems act as discrete liquidity wave resonators.

10. Failure Conditions
GRID systems fail under dominant directional liquidity flux.

11. Scope and Non-Claims
WLRT models structure, not forecasts.

12. Assumptions and Limitations
Linear response, fixed geometry, passive liquidity.

13. Conclusion
WLRT provides a causal framework where price emerges from liquidity redistribution.
