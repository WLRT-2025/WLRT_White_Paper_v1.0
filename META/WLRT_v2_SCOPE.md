# WLRT v2.0 — Scope and Architectural Boundaries
*(Internal Working Document)*

## 1. Status of WLRT v2.0

WLRT v2.0 is defined as an internal, non-canonical, exploratory extension of WLRT v1.x.  
It is not intended for public release, citation, or submission in its current form.

WLRT v1.x constitutes a closed and frozen foundational layer.  
WLRT v2.0 operates strictly on top of this foundation and does not revise, reinterpret, or amend any definitions, assumptions, or results of v1.x.

---

## 2. Purpose of WLRT v2.0

The purpose of WLRT v2.0 is to extend the foundational framework of WLRT into domains that were intentionally excluded from v1.x, while preserving its ontological integrity.

Specifically, WLRT v2.0 aims to:

- expand the state space of liquidity beyond spot markets;
- address partial observability and structural interpretation;
- analyze stabilization, control, and failure modes;
- clarify how WLRT alters interpretation even under minimal information.

WLRT v2.0 is not an empirical model, a trading framework, or a policy prescription.

---

## 3. What WLRT v2.0 Explicitly Adds

WLRT v2.0 introduces the following new conceptual layers, absent from v1.x:

### 3.1 Multilayer Liquidity Structure

- Spot liquidity
- Derivative-induced liquidity
- Synthetic and cross-market liquidity
- Institutional and long-horizon liquidity layers

These layers interact through transmission mechanisms rather than direct aggregation.

---

### 3.2 Derivative-Induced Depth and Stability

Derivatives are treated as generators of synthetic depth and as channels for transferring stability and instability across time horizons and market layers, without requiring spot execution.

---

### 3.3 Temporal Hierarchy of Liquidity

Liquidity is explicitly structured across multiple time scales:

- fast-reactive layers;
- intermediate adaptive layers;
- slow, quasi-static anchoring layers.

---

### 3.4 Partial Observability and Structural Projections

WLRT v2.0 formalizes the idea that all observable market data represent projections of an underlying liquidity field, not direct measurements.

Different data sources reveal different structural aspects of the field.

---

### 3.5 Interpretive Asymmetry and Minimal-Information Advantage

WLRT v2.0 introduces interpretive asymmetry as a core concept:

> WLRT does not reduce informational inequality,  
> but reduces interpretive inequality.

A central construct is the Minimal-Information Agent (MIA):

- an abstract agent with access only to basic price and volume data;
- without privileged, institutional, or derivative-level information.

WLRT asserts that even under minimal observability, field-based interpretation avoids systematic errors inherent in price-centric frameworks.

---

### 3.6 Stabilization, Control, and Failure Modes

WLRT v2.0 analyzes:

- liquidity control as structural forcing;
- stabilization without equilibrium assumptions;
- accumulation of latent instability;
- delayed and abrupt regime transitions.

---

## 4. What WLRT v2.0 Explicitly Does NOT Do

WLRT v2.0 does not:

- modify the ontology of WLRT v1.x;
- introduce agent-based optimization or behavioral models;
- provide trading rules, signals, or strategies;
- define operational calibration procedures;
- make normative or regulatory prescriptions.

Any applied interpretation must remain consistent with these constraints.

---

## 5. Structural Architecture of WLRT v2.0

WLRT v2.0 is organized conceptually into four layers:

### Layer 0 — Relation to WLRT v1.x  
Foundational dependence and non-revision principle.

### Part I — Extended Liquidity State Space  
Multilayer liquidity, derivatives, and temporal structure.

### Part II — Observability and Interpretation  
Partial observability, projections, interpretive asymmetry, and minimal-information agents.

### Part III — Transmission, Control, and Failure  
Stabilization mechanisms, limits of control, and regime breakdowns.

### Part IV — Market Archetypes and Applicability  
Typology of markets and conditions under which WLRT v2.0 applies or fails.

---

## 6. Canonical Development Rules

All future WLRT v2.0 work must satisfy:

- explicit separation from WLRT v1.x;
- clear labeling of v2-only concepts;
- structural consistency with field ontology;
- avoidance of premature formalization or publication.

---

## 7. Current Status

WLRT v2.0 exists as a structured conceptual map.  
Textual elaboration is deferred until architectural completeness is confirmed.
