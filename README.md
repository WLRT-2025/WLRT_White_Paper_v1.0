## Overview

Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory (WLRT) is a theoretical framework for analyzing
financial market dynamics through the spatial and temporal evolution of liquidity
across price space.

Unlike price-centric or equilibrium-based models, WLRT treats liquidity as the
primary state variable and interprets price movements as emergent outcomes driven
by liquidity gradients, propagation, concentration, and dissipation.

The theory aims to provide a unified liquidity-based description of market regimes
such as trends, consolidations, volatility expansions, and abrupt transitions.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as the primary public archive of WLRT manuscripts, including
released versions, extended developments, and technical appendices.

The repository is versioned and organized to preserve the historical evolution of
the theory while allowing ongoing extensions.
